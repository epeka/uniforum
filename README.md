🎓 UniForum

A student-led initiative helping peers succeed in standardized tests and higher education

🌍 What is UniForum?

UniForum is a community-driven platform designed to support students preparing for standardized exams such as IELTS, SAT, and NUET. Built by students for students, it combines resources, discussions, and mentorship to make test prep accessible, collaborative, and stress-free.

Our goal is to level the playing field for ambitious students from all backgrounds—especially those with limited access to quality prep materials or guidance.

🚀 Key Features

📚 Resource Library – Curated study guides, practice problems, and test strategies.

💬 Discussion Forum – Students exchange tips, ask questions, and solve problems together.

🤝 Peer Mentorship – Learn from students who’ve already succeeded in the exams.

🌐 Multilingual Access – Designed for global students, including support in Kazakh, Russian, and English.

🧩 Community Growth – A supportive space for sharing challenges, celebrating wins, and preparing for higher education opportunities.
